# I'm Ertugrul AKCA.

I've been working on computer for over 4 years. I've done websites, content management systems, database designs. I've worked on complex systems and microservice architecture. I'm working on Laravel and NodeJS on these days. 

Some Projects I've worked on:

* Gamification with Milestones
* Sales Expansion 
* Event Management System
* Online Election System
* Student Branch Management System
* CMS for a Website

When I'm not coding, I enjoy tennis(on court), books, darts, chess.
